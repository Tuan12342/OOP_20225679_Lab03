Java is Pass by Value.

This happens because Java uses pass-by-value, and for objects, what is passed is the value of the reference.

In Java, when you call a method like changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()), the title of jungleDVD is changed because the method operates on the object that the reference points to.
The return type of this method is String.
